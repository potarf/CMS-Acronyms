# Terminology used in Experimental High Energy Physics (xHEP)

critical path - needs to be done now, farthest behind, holding up progress for other tasks
exhaustion - the feeling you get after taking shifts... or helping with TestBeam, CHARM, Sourcing, or CMS installation!
legacy - originally installed, old system
next generation (ng) - newly installed (or to be installed), update to legacy, new system
robust - general, good error handling, works well consistently, well thought out, aplicable, flexible, deals with problems efficiently
subtle - challenging, difficult, hard to find and debug, easily overlooked
fermiaphilic - afraid of fermions, not likely to interact with fermions

## Data Types

### CMS Physics Data
RAW - raw physics data
RECO - reconstructed physics data

### CMS Simulated Monte Carlo (MC) Data
DIGI - digitized simulated data
GEN - generation (MC) simulated data
SIM - Geant simulated data
